### Kashifa Ghazal | Self-Taught Bioinformatician in Progress

Hi! I’m **Kashifa** — a life sciences grad who ran away from pipettes and fell into Python.  
Now I’m learning bioinformatics the *fun* way: one dataset, one bug, and one YouTube crash course at a time.

---

### What I’m Trying to Do

- Make sense of giant gene expression files 
- Play with ML models to find patterns in omics data
- Turn confusing biological data into pretty plots  
- Learn new tools faster than I forget old ones

---

### My Beginner Toolkit

`Python` • `pandas` • `matplotlib` • `bokeh`  
`Jupyter Notebooks` • `seaborn` • `scikit-learn` • `CTRL+Z` (my best friend) ...and a healthy fear of `conda environments`


Learning mostly from:
- Free online resources  
- Other people’s GitHub repos, stackoverflow, documentation
- An unhealthy number of open tabs
- Trial, error, and accidental breakthroughs
- A lot of curiosity and late-night problem-solving

---

### Projects in Progress

- AI-Powered Genomic Risk Scoring 
- Trying to predict cancer subtypes using ML 
- Keeping my files organized

---

### My (Chaotic) Learning Path

- 100% self-taught (and proud!)  
- My debugging process:  
  1. Panic  
  2. Google  
  3. Fix it  
  4. Forget how I fixed it

---

### Fun Facts

- My pipelines are powered by tea and determination  
- Most used file name: `final_final_REALLY_final_thisTime.ipynb`  
- Code now, understand later™

### Let’s Connect

If you're:
- Learning bioinformatics from scratch  
- Into coding, omics, or science memes  
- Also figuring it out as you go...

Say hi! Let’s learn, build, and maybe accidentally train a good model together.
